## Strong password rules

* At least 8 characters
* A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters
* A mixture of letters and numbers
* Inclusion of at least one special character

<p>This was the first computer system to implement a password login. This was a 30 million dollar computer, shared between users. They needed to keep private homes for each user.</p>
<p>The system was simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user types the command <code>PASSWORD</code></li>

CRYPT(3)                 BSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     crypt, crypt_r, crypt_rn, crypt_ra â€” passphrase hashing

LIBRARY
     Crypt Library (libcrypt, -lcrypt)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <crypt.h>

     char *
     crypt(const char *phrase, const char *setting);
```

<aside class="notes"><p>15 years later, in 1976 Robert Morris developed a system to store <strong>hashed</strong> passwords for UNIX 6th Edition.</p>
<p>Several years later, the algorithm was improved with the use of a 12-bit salt and invoked a modified DES algorithm 25 times to reduce the risk of dictionary attacks.</p>

<p>Most phishing messages are delivered by email, and are not personalized or targeted to a specific individual or company.</p>
<p>The content of a phishing message varies widely depending on the goal of the attacker. Common targets for impersonation include banks and financial services, email and cloud productivity providers, and streaming services.</p>

## Two-Factor Authentication
#### (Legacy <i class="fas fa-laugh-wink"></i>)

<aside class="notes"><p>Do you use Two-Factor Authentication?</p>
<p>Two-Factor Authentication is a method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user has).</p>
<p>2FA protects user data from being accessed by an unauthorized third party that may have been able to discover, for example, a single password.</p>

## What is fido2 and webauthn?

<aside class="notes"><p>Passwords tried to solve a problem in the 60s, today we have a different problem. Adding more factors and terrible UX isn&#39;t a good solution.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about passwordless security. Fast Identity Online, FIDO, is a noncommercial alliance of companies, actively interested in ending the use of passwords. FIDO2 is the latest specification, which was created with the aim of developing open and license-free standards for secure, worldwide authentication on the World Wide Web.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
![](assets/fido2.png)

<aside class="notes"><p>At its core, FIDO2 consists of the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) and the W3C standard WebAuthn.</p>
<p>Together, they enable authentication where users identify themselves with cryptographic authenticators (such as biometrics or PINs) or external authenticators (such as U2F keys, wearables or mobile devices) to a trusted WebAuthn remote peer (also known as a FIDO2 server) that typically belongs to a website or web app.</p>

</div>
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>The main goal of FIDO Alliance is to increasingly eliminate passwords on the web. To achieve this, a secure communication path between the client (browser) and the respective web services must be present.</p>
<p>Without a secure channel (HTTPS), the client will not allow you to use the <code>navigator.credentials</code> API.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

![](assets/fido2-sequence.png)

<aside class="notes"><p>Once the channel is secure, credentials are first set up or registered to be permanently available for later logins.</p>
<p>In this process, FIDO2 keys are generated and verified, which provide the basic encryption for the logon procedure. The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user registers with an online service and generates a new key pair on the device used â€” consisting of a private key and a public FIDO2 key. </li>
<li>While the private key is stored on the device and is only known on the client side, the public key is registered in the service&#39;s key database. </li>
<li>Subsequent authentications are now only possible by verification with a private key, which must always be unlocked by a user action. There are various options such as entering a PIN, pressing a button, voice input, or inserting separate two-factor hardware (FIDO2 token).</li>

## Do you need a FIDO2 token?

* Token management <i class="fab fa-chrome"></i> <i class="fab fa-edge"></i> <i class="fab fa-safari"></i> <i class="fab fa-firefox"></i>

<aside class="notes"><p>Who doesn&#39;t have either an Android or iOS phone?</p>
<p>ALL of you already have an authenticator in your pocket. Your mobile phone (Android 7 or higher), iOS 13 or higher, Windows 10 or higher with Windows HELLO are, in fact, security authenticators too.</p>
<p>When using a mobile device, your biometrics will be used to unlock the private key in the hardware. And no, your biometrics will not be shared with any FIDO2 application. They just unlock the private key.</p>
</aside></script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<!-- .element data-background-video="assets/biometrics.mp4" data-background-size="contain" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Luckily all android, ios and windows hello devices have builtin support for biometric security, so FIDO can rely on this to unlock the private key. Remember, biometrics never leave your device! they just unlock the keys!</p>

### Device Attestation

* none
* U2F (FIDO-U2F tokens, e.g.: Yubikeyâ€™s)
* Packed
* Android Key
* Android Safetynet
* TPM (Intel Trusted Platform Module 2.0)
* Apple

<aside class="notes"><p>Can we trust an authenticator?</p>
<p>During manufacturing time, an attestation certificate is burned into the device that is specific to a device model that chains to a root certificate.  The attestation is specific to a device and can be used to cryptographically prove that a user has a specific model of device when they register.</p>
<p>There are 7 kinds of attestation. Most apps should use none.</p>
<p>None because you aren&#39;t really concerned about the device, you only want your users not to use passwords!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re building more secure services, like, PSD2 banking, you may want to be sure your user device can be trusted.</p>
<p>For example, when validating android devices, you can check if a device is rooted or not and prevent it from being registered as it could be a security compromise.</p>

### Meta Data Service 3.0

![](assets/titan.png)

<aside class="notes"><p>Attestation introduces a strong chain of trust. There is a fully secure chain of certificates from the hardware of the device to your application. But there always will be bugs, or worse, security bugs.</p>
<p>FIDO Alliance offers a public service. The MDS3. The Metadata Service, allows the verification of devices which pass the chain of trust, but are known to have security issues.</p>
<p>The vert.x library, I&#39;ve shown, can query the service and deny registration of devices known to have such problems.</p>

## Privacy

![](assets/faang.jpg)

<aside class="notes"><p>The FIDO2 specification is designed to protect the user&#39;s privacy. No information is passed on that could give a hint about further web activities. Furthermore, biometric data, when used, never leaves the user device.</p>
<p>FIDO2 gives us a truly decentralized, secure, convenient and scalable solution to implement privacy-aware authentication.</p>
<p>This mechanism also ensures that data at rest is secure. Database dumps are not a security liability.</p>

### GDPR + Data at rest

```json [|5-8|2-4]
{
  "credID"    : "lqxqLLT7ulN8i8mkp7yp5srG11hYGKn" â†©
                "-8un_r74qb9DmbqUyebEgCiEKjgWJ_X" â†©

  "counter"   : 2
}
```

<aside class="notes"><p>While in most traditional systems, we store hashed passwords with variable salts to delay the time to break, with FIDO2, we only store a public key. Public keys were never intended to be used as secrets, so there is absolutely no problem storing them or worrying about them to be leaked.</p>
<p>The public key, without the secret counterpart (which <strong>NEVER</strong> leaves the authenticator) is of no use to an attacker.</p>
<p>The protocol goes a step further by replacing usernames, with an anonymous credential ID, making it truly GDPR-compliant.</p>

## Account recovery

![](assets/pheonix.jpeg)

<aside class="notes"><p>What about account recovery? What if you lose your device/authenticator? Then you&#39;re locked. This is a good thing! If there are no backdoors to get the private keys, it means you can&#39;t leak sensitive information that could be used against you. Remember, if you lose your phone, the private key must be unlocked with your biometrics!</p>
<p>It is important to always account for multiple key registration in your services. Multiple keys are important as they allow users to perform recovery without falling back to less secure authentication mechanisms like 2FA or passwords.</p>
<p>Of course, FIDO Alliance is working on improving the account recovery flow, and Apple, for example, already supports this to some extent with the FIDO2 iCloud.</p>
